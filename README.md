# 3D-Torus-Tic-Tac-Toe-4x4x4
AGH university of science and technology Krak√≥w - Poland - June 2022
A project for my C++ course at the 2nd year of computer science studies
The project is a 3 dimensional 4x4x4 tic tac toe game on 3 dimensional torus written in C++ language
To implement GUI I used SDL library with SDL_image and SDL_ttg

The project was written entirely using Clion ide on windows 10 operating system
I also included CMakeList.txt file with needed SDL configurations
The font used in the project can be found at https://www.1001fonts.com/pixel-font.html 
It is marked as "Free for commercial use"
Implemented game_map can be used to create bigger maps for similar games
